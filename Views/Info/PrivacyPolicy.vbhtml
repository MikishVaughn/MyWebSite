            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and
            online services to post a privacy policy.  The law"s reach stretches well beyond
            California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably
            the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
            from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website
            stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom
            it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -  <button @*style="color: white; text-decoration-line:underline; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black, 2px 2px 8px #994300;"*@ id="newTab" onclick="newTab('http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf')">Click Here for More Info.</button>

            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13,
            the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
            The Federal Trade Commission, the nation"s consumer protection agency, enforces
            the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services
            must do to protect children"s privacy and safety online.

        <div class="gradientheading">Fair Information Practices</div>
        <div class="p_div">
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
            United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the
            development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
            Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
            comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
        </div>
        <div class="p_div">
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

        <div class="p_div">We will notify the users via email</div>
        <div class="p_div_bullet">Within 7 business days</div>

        <div class="p_div_bullet">Within 7 business days</div>
        <div class="p_div">
            We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals
            have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and
            processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
            individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
            have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute
            non-compliance by data processors.
